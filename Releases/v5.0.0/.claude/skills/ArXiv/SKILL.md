## Customization

**Before executing, check for user customizations at:**
`$PAI_DATA_DIR/USER/SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS/ArXiv/`

If this directory exists, load and apply any PREFERENCES.md, configurations, or resources found there. These override default behavior. If the directory does not exist, proceed with skill defaults.

# ArXiv

Search arXiv for latest papers by topic or category. Uses arXiv's Atom API for search/discovery and AlphaXiv's markdown endpoint for enriched paper overviews. No API keys needed.

## Workflow Routing

| Trigger | Workflow |
|---------|----------|
| "latest papers in X", "new papers on X", "what's new in AI research" | `Workflows/Latest.md` |
| "search arxiv for X", "find papers about X", "arxiv papers on X" | `Workflows/Search.md` |
| arxiv URL, paper ID like `2401.12345`, "explain this paper" | `Workflows/Paper.md` |

## Quick Reference

**arXiv API** (no auth):
- Base: `https://export.arxiv.org/api/query`
- Search fields: `ti:` (title), `au:` (author), `abs:` (abstract), `cat:` (category), `all:` (everything)
- Booleans: `AND`, `OR`, `ANDNOT`
- Sort: `sortBy=lastUpdatedDate&sortOrder=descending` for latest
- Pagination: `start=0&max_results=10` (max 2000 per call)
- Rate limit: 3s between calls

**AlphaXiv enrichment** (no auth):
- Overview: `curl -s "https://alphaxiv.org/overview/{PAPER_ID}.md"`
- Full text: `curl -s "https://alphaxiv.org/abs/{PAPER_ID}.md"` (fallback)
- Not all papers have overviews — 404 means analysis not yet generated

**Key categories for our work:**
- `cs.AI` — Artificial Intelligence
- `cs.LG` — Machine Learning
- `cs.CL` — Computation and Language (NLP/LLMs)
- `cs.CR` — Cryptography and Security
- `cs.SE` — Software Engineering
- `cs.MA` — Multi-Agent Systems
- `cs.IR` — Information Retrieval

## Gotchas

- arXiv API **requires HTTPS** and `-L` (follows redirects). HTTP 301s to HTTPS silently.
- arXiv API returns Atom XML, not JSON. Parse with text processing, not `jq`.
- `lastUpdatedDate` includes edits to old papers. For truly new submissions, check `<published>` dates.
- AlphaXiv overviews are AI-generated summaries. Great for quick understanding, but verify claims against the actual paper for anything you'd cite.
- arXiv API rate limit is 3 seconds between calls. Batch your queries.
- `max_results` caps at 2000. For broader sweeps, paginate with `start`.
- Category search (`cat:cs.AI`) returns papers with that as primary OR cross-listed category.

## Execution Log

After completing any workflow, append a single JSONL entry:

```bash
echo '{"ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","skill":"ArXiv","workflow":"WORKFLOW_USED","input":"8_WORD_SUMMARY","status":"ok|error","duration_s":SECONDS}' >> $PAI_DATA_DIR/MEMORY/SKILLS/execution.jsonl
```
